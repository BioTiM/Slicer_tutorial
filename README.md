# How to read this guide

The main sections seen in the table of contents above are generally independent from each other, so you can use this manual as a reference (actually, this manual *is* more a reference than a step-by-step guide).

The manual is rich in inline references, which are hyperlinks that bring you to the web page where the information comes from. Apart from that, sections and subsections have some standalone references at the end, which let you further immerse in the topic.

If you notice typos, inaccurate or untrue information, or have questions or suggestions, please contact us (see section [**Contributing**](#contributing)) to improve this manual.
